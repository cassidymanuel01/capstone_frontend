      <h2>About us</h2>
      <p>At Gliss we are a proud team of workers looking to satisfy and relax our customers. Origionally created in 2022 we started as a small home run business with a maximum of 3 customers a day. We had a meeting one day about looking to expend and thats when we decided to take a leap of faith and just rent out a space.</p>
      <br>
        <p>We eventually started to expand into a website and this proved to be very advantages as our customers had easier and better service they acess to all the information they needed and overall business ran much smoother... boom thats our about page.</p>
